# Medical Image Segmentation for Disease Detection and Categorization
Repository for Computer Vision Project on Medical Image Segmentation.

## Setup

1. Clone Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/rB080/medseg.git
```

2. Create a new python virtual environment as: 
```
python -m venv path/to/env/medseg
```

or alternatively, you can create a conda environment using:

```
conda create -n medseg python=3.10
```

3. Activate environment:
```
source path/to/env/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Codebase

All training and evaluation scripts have been provided in ```.\scrips```. The arrangement is based on standard pytorch based repository implementations.
